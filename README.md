## 📊 Data Preview
Your data is stored securely in `atm_data.json`. An example of the saved data structure:
```json
{
  "balance": 20050.0,
  "transactions": [
    "2026-04-23 00:54:05 - Deposit: +$50000.00",
    "2026-04-23 00:54:22 - Withdraw: -$30000.00"
  ]
}
```

## 🛡️ Security & Validation
* **Amount Validation**: The system ensures you cannot deposit or withdraw negative amounts.
* **Input Safety**: Uses `try-except` blocks to prevent the program from crashing if a user enters text instead of numbers.
* **Fund Integrity**: Withdrawals are automatically blocked if the requested amount exceeds the available balance.
